# PietSmiet-App f√ºr Android

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/l3d00m/pietsmiet_android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/l3d00m/pietsmiet_android)

## Information
Still under active development and pre-alpha.

This app is focused on performance and clean code. This is achieved by using very helpful libraries such as RxJava & Retrofit. I'm trying to use Model-View-Presenter pattern for developing this.  
SQLite is used to cache objects. The app communicates with the Twitter & Facebook API for getting it's content. It also uses RSS in combination with JSOUP for scraping content from pietsmiet.de

## Features

* Last tweets and facebook posts from Team Pietsmiet

* Latest Uploadplan

* Notifications for new Uploadplan and pietsmiet.de videos (WIP)

* A beatiful and intuitive interface, based on material design.
