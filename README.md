## Information & goal

This app is focused on performance and clean code. This is achieved by using very helpful libraries such as RxJava & Retrofit. I'm trying to use Model-View-Presenter pattern for developing this.  
SQLite is used to cache objects. The app communicates with the Twitter & Facebook API for getting it's content. It also uses RSS in combination with JSOUP for scraping content from pietsmiet.de
